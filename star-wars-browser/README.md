# Star Wars Browser

## what is this project about

Browsing for informations about Star Wars Characters

## how to install

1. Install node.js -> it will automatically install npm
2. Get to main folder (cd recruitment-task-bpol)
3. Get to task subfolder (cd star-wars-browser)
3. Switch to branch develop (git checkout develop) as on master branch you can find only pure html/css build
3. type npm i   -> it will download necessary dependencies
4. type npm start to run project


## additional notes

In my opinion all this fetching work could be done much better with downloading all necessary data at once and then extracting necessary info, but API promotes chaining
